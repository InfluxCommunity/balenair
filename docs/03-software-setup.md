# 3. Software setup

Now that you have your hardware set up and connected, it's time to install the software...

At a minimum, you'll need software to flash the SD card that will be inserted into the Raspberry Pi. We recommend [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher).

There are three main ways to deploy the software to your device...

## The open fleet option
If you want the simplest software deployment and automatic updates for your device, choose this option. An open fleet is a group of devices that all run the same code that anyone can join. We make it easy to join open fleets on balenaHub, our platform for IoT users to exchange resources. To join your device to the IAQ open fleet, click here. (coming soon!)

Next click on the "get started" button and choose your model of Raspberry Pi from the dropdown list. For "Network Connection" choose "WiFi + Ethernet" and enter your WiFi SSID and password. (Note: these credentials are only stored inside the file you will be downloading and are not saved anywhere else.) Now, click the "Flash" button which will open balenaEtcher (if previously installed) and guide you through flashing the image to your microSD card.

### Notes about open fleets
- You don't need a balenaCloud account (free or paid) to join an open fleet

- The "fleet owner" for this open fleet is balenAir itself

- Your device's sensor data is potentially visible to the fleet owner, but not other members of the fleet

- balenAir does not save or view your sensor data except as needed for troubleshooting purposes initiated by a user

- If you want a private fleet (where you will be the fleet owner) choose one of the other two options below

## One-click deploy option
This option allows you to deploy and configure the IAQ with the single click of a button. It will create a new private fleet in your balenaCloud account. If you don't already have a free balenaCloud account, it will prompt you to create one. Use the button below to get started:

### Fleet Configuration
Before adding a device to your fleet, you'll need to configure the fleet. Click on the "Fleet Configuration" tab and add the following environment variables:

*IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO USE THE INFLUXDB REPLICATION FEATURE DO NOT SET THE REPLICATION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE*

As this will lead to issues within the InfluxDB setup script. You may also leave out the following:
* INFLUXDB_CLOUD_BUCKET_ID
* INFLUXDB_CLOUD_HOST
* INFLUXDB_CLOUD_ORG_ID
* INFLUXDB_CLOUD_TOKEN

```
REPLICATION
true
All services

INFLUXDB_CLOUD_BUCKET_ID	
<INSERT OWN CLOUD BUCKET ID>
All services	

INFLUXDB_CLOUD_HOST	
<INSERT OWN CLOUD HOST ID>
All services	

INFLUXDB_CLOUD_ORG_ID	
<INSERT OWN CLOUD ORG ID>
All services	

INFLUXDB_CLOUD_TOKEN	
<INSERT OWN CLOUD TOKEN>
All services	
```


Once your application has been created you'll need to add a device to it:

1. Add a device to the application by clicking the "add device" button. Don't forget to add WiFi credentials here if applicable!
2. Download the OS and flash it to your SD card with [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)
3. Power up your device and check it's online in the dashboard!

The IAQ application will start downloading as soon as your device appears in the dashboard.


## Balena CLI option

This is the more advanced approach for deploying applications to balena powered devices. Choose this option if you want to customize or modify the code before deploying to your device. You'll need to download and install the [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md). See the balena [Getting Started Guide](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started/raspberrypi4-64/python/) for more details.

## Having trouble?

If you are running into issues getting your IAQ software running, please try the following:
1. Check the support and troubleshooting guide for common issues and how to resolve them. (coming soon!)
2. Post in the [forums](https://forums.balena.io/) for help from our growing community.
3. [Create an issue](https://github.com/balenair/balenair/issues) if you find your issue may be a bug or problem with the IAQ software.
